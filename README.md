This is a complete infrastructure for hosting a fasttext based text classification algorithm, and should be extensible to train other types of models on various data sets.

It's still a bit far from being fully functional. the goal is to be able to test different models quickly, and configure training for various / data structures. Some sample use case will be provided. (email classification, virtual assistant)

The infrastructure is very basic and meant for a proof of concept.

instructions : 

git clone https://github.com/TheCodingLand/neural-net-ctg.git

cd neural-net-ctg

docker-compose up

possible to scale up using :
docker-compose <service> scale=x

for example using pre trained vectors :

./fasttext skipgram -input UNLABELED_DATA -output UNSUP_VECTORS

./fasttext supervised -input LABELED_DATA -output MODEL -pretrainedVectors UNSUP_VECTORS.vec
